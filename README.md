# Fine-tuning Graph Neural Networks by Preserving Graph Generative Patterns
## G-Tuning
This repo is the implementation of paper â€œFine-tuning Graph Neural Networks by Preserving Graph Generative Patterns" accepted by AAAI' 24.


Hope to present this work smoothly in Vancouver in February, 2024!

## Status
Now we have updated our model on GCC version, namely the Table 2 in our paper. More code and details will be uploaded within this month. :)
